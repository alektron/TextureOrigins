## Description
Example program for my blog post ["No, OpenGL's texture origin is not in the lower left corner!"](https://alek-tron.com/TextureOrigins/TextureOrigins.html).
It is meant to show that textures or UV coordinates do not need to be flipped when rendering with different graphics APIs.

## Requirements
Not included in this repository but necessary to build and run:
- glew: glew.h and binaries must be put directly into the root directory
